# ASTROAPI by Jayden

- So this is a fun project I'm making. I want to make a fun little app that displays information about a planet/body when you hover your mouse over it.

## TO DO

1. Fetch API data and render it on page

- My problem with fetching data is how constantly i've been bouncing between different techniques. Primarily i've been using React hooks to fetch data, however the documentation for React says that it's best practice to use class components with the ComponentDidMount life cycle. I think I'm going to try to stick to that, as the React hooks have been causing me way too many problems.

2. Make it look nice and fancy
